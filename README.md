# Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app:

Alot of people need money for various reasons. Some people have a great idea that needs funding. Other people need money for food because they are homeless. Either way, a platform in which individuals are able to request money from strangers for various reasons is a great way to help people.
That is exactly what this website will do. It will give individuals the ability to request an amount of money from people, provide a reason so people are able to decide whether they want to donate, then instantly connect and gain the ability to transfer funds directly to them.
currently, there are websites that allow you to do this but can often take a hefty percentage of the trade and can be problematic to authorise an account and payment system.
